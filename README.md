Deliverables from an internship as an "Internship Developer" for Computing for All

## Overview
- As an intern at [Computing for All](https://www.computingforall.org/) pioneering their "internship factory" concept, I was responsible for creating detailed documentation of workflows and key technologies that would onboard future interns and provide continuity for contributions to partner open-source projects.  The partner project that I worked with was [WECO](https://github.com/wecollective). 

## Internship Learning Outcomes
1. Understand and demonstrate the setup of a Node.js development environment.
2. Create a simple Node.js project.
3. Use and understand React.
4. Use basic Amazon Web Services cloud functionality.
5. Learn and understand the supporting tech stack used on weco.io. This includes Express.js, Socket.io and SCSS.

## Additional Achievements
- Learned advanced Github tools.  Worked with Github projects and contributed documentation to resolve issues for WECO.

## Deliverables
### Setup a Node.js Dev Environment
### Practice React Todo App
A todo app built following a tutorial to gain experience with Node and React.
Github repo [here](https://github.com/owleyeview/practice-react-todos).
### Practice Chat App
A simple chat app. Built from scratch to become more familiar with the WECO tech stack of React, Express, Node and Socket.io.  I created detailed documentation so other interns can build this app as a learning exercise.

### Internship Documentation
Please see the [cfa-internship-documentation folder](https://github.com/owleyeview/cfa-internship-documents/tree/main/documents/cfa-internship-documentation)
### WECO Documentation
I created a document for WECO's wiki that details their app architecture.  This document is intended to orient developers to the WECO code base and make it easier to contribute code to this open-source project.
