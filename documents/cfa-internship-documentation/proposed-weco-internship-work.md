# Proposed Framework for Learning Core WECO Features

 For each of the core components of [[WECO]], posts, spaces, users, etc...
- How is this implemented on WECO?
- Pros and cons?
- Document it to explain it to other interns.
- What are other ways this could be done?
- Which alternatives could align with WECO's goals, now or in the future?
- Create a test implementation of one alternative.
- Doing a few to all of these steps could be useful.
